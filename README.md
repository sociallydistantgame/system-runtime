# Socially Distant
## System Runtime

This is a Unity package designed to be embedded into Socially Distant itself. It provides core APIs needed by the game. You can use this runtime to build mods for the game without needing to decompile the game's binaries.

The Socially Distant Runtime does not and never will contain any of the game's internal logic or gameplay code. It simply acts as an interface for interacting with the game through a standard API.
